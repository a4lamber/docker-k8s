# 47 container lifetime and persistent data

Containers are usually immutable and ephemeral. In human-readable words, it means they are disposable and can't be changed when running. pre-docker era, 你需要deploy在server上，如果需要调整，你就直接change the config or setting. 但对于docker来说，如果你change any setting, 你只有重新re-deploy, 这种新的deploy的概念，叫做immutable instastructure, 

> `immutable infrastructure`: only re-deploy containers, never changes


|problem|solution|
|---|---|
|re-deploy means it takes a long time|hash the operation in the `Dockerfile`, only redeploy the downstream of first changes to the `Dockerfile`|
|data disappear after re-deploy|Docker Volumes; Bind mounts|

## bind mount vs volume

A `bind mount` is a direct mapping between a directory or file on the host machine and a directory or file in the container. This means that any changes made to the file or directory on the host machine are immediately reflected in the container, and vice versa. Bind mounts are useful for development environments where you want to make changes to your code on the host machine and immediately see the results in the container.

A `volume`, on the other hand, is a managed directory that is stored outside of the container's file system. Volumes allow you to persist data even after the container is destroyed, and they can be shared between multiple containers. Volumes are useful for storing data that needs to be shared across containers or for storing data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a container.
